      <p>
          <img src="url" alt="Picture of me">
          Here is a little about myself. I am 29 years old and currently living in South Dakota. I have a girlfriend and two cats (one of which who loves to jump on the keyboard to input her ideas)!
          I was in the military for 6 years before being honorably discharged. After going to school for a while, I decided I wanted to become a software engineer.
          My passion lies in video games, but I also enjoy working with apps and websites in whatever ways I can. It is fun being able to test out new ideas and get a project to work!
